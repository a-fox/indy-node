Welcome to Hyperledger Indy documentation!
============================================

This documentation is designed to give you a holistic understanding into Hyperledger Indy. It's structured so that you can get high level understanding of Indy quickly, as well as find the required resources to dive deeper under the hood to get you started with development. It also aims to explain the deeper background and history of Indy and what's required of identity networks to become truly self-sovereign identity supporting.

* By reading the :doc:`key concepts <KeyConcepts>`, you should get a thorough understanding on how Indy works and what are all the components that make up Indy.

* :doc:`Getting started -section <GettingStarted>` will help you test Indy by going through simple excercises. These will require some tech knowledge, but you will have a good guide to go through it.

* :doc:`The developer guide <DeveloperGuide>` is your home, if you're looking to have a peek under the hood of Indy.

* If you're interested in how Indy makes global trust networks a possibility, and how you join a trust framework, then jump to :doc:`the background -section. <Background>`

Hope you enjoy the ride!
